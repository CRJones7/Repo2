    <p>A cow has 32 teeth, and no top teeth. A cow will chew about 50 times in a minute, making their jaws move about
        40,000 times a day.</p>

    <p>A bathtub can hold between 30 and 50 gallons of water. Did you know that a cow can drink that much water in just
        one day?
        With all of the eating and drinking that a cow does in one day, they will urinate about 30 gallons and produce
        about 60 pounds of manure. So in one year, a cow will produce about 20,100 pounds of manure – that’s 10 TONS!
